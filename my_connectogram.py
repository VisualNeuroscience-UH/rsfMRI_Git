'''
This module creates Make_Connectogram instance which read excel workbook containing SVR model connection weights. These weights
are created with Craddock (Neuroimage 2013) analysis of functional MRI resting state measurement. The MakeConnectogram instance 
builds link file for connectogram and runs circos, a perl program which builds the graphical circular representation.

You can call the instance with do_histogram() method to just view the histogram.

Excel file names should start with GrpNum_sessionN_ , eg "sub011_session2_"

You need to define
work_path:  the path to your connectogram root, including folders "data" and "etc" and actual data folders 
threshold = (min,max) eg (-0.00002,0.00002): values between min and max will be set to 0
histogram = 0 or 1 # If 1, show histogram and stop program execution. 
distances = 0 or 1 # If 1, will scale the data to connection weight scale for easier comparison with same colors etc. 
heatmaps = 0 or 1 # if 1, do heatmaps for circos. Note, if N heatmaps is not 5, the circos_heatmap.conf needs manual tuning
	Heatmaps contain:	1) Voxel counts in each ROI
						2) Average shortest path
						3) Centrality degree
						4) Centrality eigenvector
						5) Clustering

Necessary files, position starting from connectogram root
'data\structure.label.txt'
'data\segments.txt'
'map.roi.names.xlsx'
'etc\circos.conf'
'etc\circos_heatmap.conf'
'etc\bands.conf'
'etc\color.brain.conf'
'etc\heatmap.conf'
'etc\ideogram.conf'
'etc\ideogram.label.conf'
'etc\ideogram.position.conf'
'etc\segment.order.conf'
'etc\ticks.conf'
'etc\ticks_heatmap.conf'

The program need to be in the path or you need to run it from the folder containting the "my_connectogram.py" and "make_connectogram.py". 
However, if it stops with exception, and the program files are not in your path, you may need to cd back to the folder containing 
the aforementioned files.
