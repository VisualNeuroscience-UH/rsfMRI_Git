Resting state functional magnetic imaging data analysis.

Circos analysis needs PERL installed. My version of circos is included. See http://circos.ca/software/ for full info, tutorials etc. The "data" and "etc" circos folders as well as mapping between ROI full names in excel files and their abbreviations depend on project. Project folders are named PROJECT_Connectogram.

This toolbox is tested in Python 3.7.
